      <h3> After watching Korean dramas... </h3>
      <p> Indulging in so many different Korean dramas and watching Kpop videos, I have developed a desire to visit some attractions in South Korea. </p>

      <p> The very first drama that I watched was called <a href="http://asianwiki.com/Boys_Over_Flowers_-_Korean_Drama" target="_blank">Boys Over Flowers</a>. It featured <em>Namsam Tower</em> and various food dishes. So, why not visit the tower itself and a food market?

      <br>
      <br>

        <img src="images/namsamtower.jpg" alt="photo of namsam tower" width="420 pixals">
        <img src="images/streetmarket.jpg" alt="photo of a korean street market" width="420 pixals">

      <br>

      <p> Two words that most people will connect with South Korea are: <strong>Gangnam and Kimchi.</strong>

      <br>
      <br>

        <img src="images/gangnam.jpg" alt="photo of a street in gangnam district" width="280 pixals">
        <img src="images/kimchi.jpg" alt="photo of a dish of kimchi" width="420 pixals">

      <br>

      <p> I am a big fan of Kimchi now, and I would probably visit Gangnam district, but I have watched enough shows to know that it's not the best area to get a cultural experience in South Korea.

      <br>
      <br>

      <p> The above images are show some of the interests that I have in South Korea, but the one that a single image doesn't do justice to is Jeju Island. The island is a popular leisure and wealthy travel destination for many drama characters. </p>

      <p> Follow the <a href= https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g983296-Jeju_Island-Vacations.html>Jeju Island</a> link to a travel website to peak your own interest. </p>
