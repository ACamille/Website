    <h2>It started with a train ride</h2>

      <br>
      <br>

    <p>The conversation went as follows...</p>
      <br>
    <p><strong>Friend</strong>: My friend has lent me a few Korean dramas for the trip. Would you like to watch one with me?</p>
      <br>
    <p><strong>Me</strong>: No, that's ok. I have my iPod and a few movies on my laptop. You go ahead, thank you for the offer though.</p>
      <br>
    <p><em>10 mins later: I have been listening to my iPod... and reading subtitles over her shoulder the whole time.</em></p>
      <br>
    <p><strong>Friend</strong>: Are you sure that you don't want to join me?</p>
      <br>
    <p>... and that is how it began.</p>
      <br>
    <p><strong><i>The trip from Vancouver took 5 days, or 25 episodes, to get to Toronto</i></strong></p>

      <p> The first drama that I watched was called, <a href="http://asianwiki.com/Boys_Over_Flowers_-_Korean_Drama" target="_blank">Boys Over Flowers</a>. It follows the trials and tribulations of a young, working-class girl named Gum Jan-Di. She ends up in the top high school for the rich and wealthy, and through many misunderstanding (and often unbelievable events), she get's entangled in the lives of the F4, the schools elite group of boys. Their leader is Gu Jun-Pyo, the selfish and arrogant heir to one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The drama includes all the classic hallmarks of a romantic drama. It is full of highs and lows, delicious food, and an epic soundtrack.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Nostalgia takes over whenever I hear a song from this drama, or if I re-watch it (which I have, several times). However, the single most important part of BOF, is the cast.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Lee Min Ho is the lead male actor, and to this day he remains my absolute favorite.</p>
